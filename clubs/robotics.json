We are all passionate for what we do: whether it be design, build, programming, or outreach, we do our best to spread the wonder of robotics everywhere. At our competitive school, each individual member may be busy with many other things, but in the end we all come together with our work to represent the best STEM ability of Boston Latin. We strive to make the most of the resources we get, but we give back to the community we work in through workshops and lessons. As we continue to grow as a team, we remain committed to innovation, collaboration, and sharing our passion for robotics with others.As we continue to grow as a team, we remain committed to innovation, collaboration, and sharing our passion for robotics with others."
