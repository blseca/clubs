<h1>Methods of Study</h1>
<p>By no means the only way to study History Bowl, but here are some ideas on what you could do, whether you are experienced or not.  <h3> Focus </h3> <p> using time efficiently to dig deep into a specialization and become an expert in it. </p> <h2> Getting Started </h2><p>There are official topics that you need to know linked below. Look up what to study in your particular specialization.</p> <h2>Initial steps</h2><p>    Keeping in mind your specialization, find the resources on the History Bowl tab, and search on the internet. Reading far and wide as well as in depth is helpful. Crash Course is probably superficial by this point, so find articles or videos that explains the area in depth.     </p><h2> Studying</h2><p>Memorize and maybe take notes. Watch specific videos if it enhances your understanding of an event or person. (2x speed w/ captions)</p><p>Make flashcards(if that helps), and learn details. There are also premade quizlet sets. </p><h2> Practice</h2><p>Come to Practices(Virtual or In-Person)</p><p>Do Sample Problems from websites on your own. <ul><li>Try to get them as quickly as possible, reading from the top. Protobowl or Qbreader are useful for this</li><li>When encountering 3rd quarter sets relating to your expertise, try to know the first three questions for sure, and have reasonable guesses for 3 more.</li></ul></p><h2> Next Steps</h2><p>    Read into weak spots that come up, or if clarification is needed from one of the problems. For persistent areas, read in detail and watch people explain it in videos.</p><p>    Once you have a good grip on your specialty, you can try to tackle a lesser category. Perhaps tack on a bit of Literary History, Sports, or Music!! </p><h2> Before The Competition</h2><p>With your team:</p><ul>    <li>Know when and where it is</li>    <li>Understanding what each player is good at</li>    <li>Figure out strategies for buzzing</li></ul><p>By yourself: do what you think you need to do to be successful in the competition! See above</p><p>Eat a good breakfast. Get a good night's sleep! </p><h2> After The Competition</h2><p>    Debrief. Evaluate objectively how you did and what you can improve upon. </p><p>    Build a bit of time into the week to watch some fun History videos, or a book. It will help you next time!</p><p>    If you want, take some challenging history classes, like APWH or APUSH at school!</p></p>
