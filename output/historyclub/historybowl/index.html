<h1>History Bowl</h1>
<p>History Bowl is a buzzer-based competition for students of all grades. We offer Varsity and JV divisions. With coaching from alumni and teachers with competition experience, we send well-prepared teams to state and national level qualifiers, culminating in the nationwide competition in DC. Our season is in the spring, from January to April. We welcome all to participate, and offer everyone who wishes a chance to compete.</p>
